# Introduction

Source IP address spoofing facilitates various malicious attacks, and Outbound Source Address Validation (OSAV) remains the best current practice for preventing spoofed packets from exiting a network. Accurately measuring OSAV deployment is essential for investigating the Internetâ€™s vulnerability to IP spoofing. However, such measurements typically require sending spoofed packets from within the tested network, necessitating cooperation from network operators.

OSAVRoute is the first non-cooperative system capable of capturing the fine-grained characteristics of OSAV deployment. Unlike existing non-cooperative methods that can only identify the ** presence ** and **absence** of OSAV, OSAVRoute identifies both the **presence** and **absence** of OSAV and further measures its **blocking granularity** and **blocking depth**, achieving capabilities previously limited to cooperative methods. OSAVRoute accomplishes this by explicitly tracing the forwarding paths of spoofed packets, enabling identification of their generation and propagation behavior.

# Compilation
OSAVRoute with DNS can be compiled with
```bash
cd osavroute_dns && go build -o osavroute_dns
```
OSAVRoute with TCP can be compiled with
```bash
cd osavroute_tcp && go build -o osavroute_tcp
```
OSAVRoute requires Go 1.22 or later.

# Usage

## Stateless scanning
For stateless scanning, the common usage is
```bash
osavroute_dns -o <OUTPUT_DIR> -pps <PACKET_PER_SECOND> -nsend <N_SENDERS> -domain <DOMAIN>
```
- `OUTPUT_DIR` specifies the path to store output files. When scanning is finished, there will be three directories in `OUTPUT_DIR`:

   - `OUTPUT_DIR/dns` stores response messages except ICMP Time-Exceeds messages received. Each line in each file is `<ORG_ADDR>,<RESP_ADDR>,<RESP_TYPE>`. `<ORG_ADDR>` is the destination address of the initial probing packet. `<RESP_ADDR>` is the responding address. `<RESP_TYPE>` is the protocol type of the response.

   - `OUTPUT_DIR/icmp` stores intermediate files and is usually unimportant.

   - `OUTPUT_DIR/icmp-re` stores ICMP Time-Exceeds messages received. Each line in each file is `<ORG_ADDR>,<FD_ADDR>,<RESP_ADDR>,<TTL>`. `<FD_ADDR>` is the destination address when the probing packet's TTL decreases to 0. `<TTL>` is the TTL of the initial probing packet.

- `<PACKET_PER_SECOND>` is the user-defined sending rate. 
- `<N_SENDERS>` is the number of goroutines used for sending packets. Larger `<PACKET_PER_SECOND>` requires larger `<N_SENDERS>`.

- `<DOMAIN>` is the domain used for stateless scanning.

To use OSAVRoute with TCP, execute the following command:
```bash
osavroute_tcp -o <OUTPUT_DIR> -r <REMOTE_PORT> -pps <PACKET_PER_SECOND> -nsend <N_SENDERS>
```
The output format is similar to `osavroute_dns`; however, `osavroute_tcp` stores response messages in the `OUTPUT_DIR/tcp` directory rather than `OUTPUT_DIR/dns`. Furthermore, you must specify the target TCP port using the `-r <REMOTE_PORT>` option.

## Early-filtering scanning
For early-filtering scanning, the common usage is

```bash
osavroute_dns -mode=early -i <INPUT_FILE> -d <DNS_OUT_FILE> -o <ICMP_OUT_FILE> -domain <DOMAIN> -rand <RAND_PFX>
```
In this command,
- `<INPUT_FILE>` specifies the input file containing addresses you want to scan. This file is formatted by one address on each line.
- `<DNS_OUT_FILE>` specifies the path to store DNS responses and is formatted as 
   > `<ORG_ADDR>,<RESP_ADDR>,<TTL>` 

   on each line.
- `<ICMP_OUT_FILE>` specifies the path to store ICMP Time-Exceeds messages and is formatted as 
   > `<ORG_ADDR>,<RESP_ADDR>,<TTL>`

   on each line.
- `<DOMAIN>` is the domain used for scanning.
- `<RAND_PFX>` is a prefix string added to the query domain to distinguish between different scans.

On the ADNS side, you can receive DNS queries of domains in the following format:
> \<RAND_PFX\>.\<TTL\>.\<IP_HEX\>.\<IS_NORMAL\>.\<DOMAIN\>

- `<RAND_PFX>` is the random prefix specified by the user in the command.
- `<TTL>` is the Time-To-Live value of the probing packet that triggers this DNS query.
- `<IP_HEX>` is the probed IP address in the hex format.
- `<IS_NORMAL>` indicates the type of packet that triggered the DNS query:
    - `1` is triggered by a normal packet.
    - `0` is triggered by a spoofed packet.
- `<DOMAIN>` is the he domain specified by the user in the command.

## Blocking granularity scanning
For blocking granularity scanning, the common usage is

```bash
osavroute_dns -mode=gran -i <INPUT_FILE> -domain <DOMAIN> -rand <RAND_PFX>
```
In this command,

- `<INPUT_FILE>` specifies the input file containing addresses you want to scan. This file is formatted by one address on each line. 
- `<DOMAIN>` is the domain used for scanning.

ADNS receives DNS queries for domains in the following format:

> \<RAND_PFX\>.\<GRAN\>.\<IP_HEX\>.4.\<DOMAIN\>

- `<RAND_PFX>` is the random prefix specified by the user in the command.
- `<GRAN>` is the blocking granularity tested by the probing packet that triggers the DNS query.
- `<IP_HEX>` is the probed IP address in hexadecimal format.
- `4` indicates that the DNS query is triggered by a blocking granularity scan.
- `<DOMAIN>` is the domain specified by the user in the command.

# Note
1. OSAVRoute can automatically find your network interface and destination MAC address (MAC address of your gateway). However, you can always specify them by:
   ```bash
   osavroute_dns -o <OUTPUT_DIR> -pps <PACKET_PER_SECOND> -nsend <N_SENDERS> -iface <NETWORK_INTERFACE> -dmac <DEST_MAC>
   ```
2. You **SHOULD** own the domain used for stateless scanning, unless doing so would be unethical, as the scanning will draw DNS traffic to the owner's ADNS.
3. You **MUST** own the domain used for early-filtering scanning and blocking granularity scanning. The ADNS must also be configured to receive DNS queries. The configuration of the ADNS is not specified here.
4. Early-filtering and blocking granularity scanning is based on DNS, and OSAVRoute with TCP cannot run them.
5. For more details, you can run
   ```bash
   osavroute_dns -h
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   osavroute_tcp -h
   ```
