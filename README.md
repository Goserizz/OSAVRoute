# Introduction

Source IP address spoofing facilitates various malicious attacks, and Outbound Source Address Validation (OSAV) remains the best current practice for preventing spoofed packets from exiting a network. Accurately measuring OSAV deployment is essential for investigating the Internetâ€™s vulnerability to IP spoofing. However, such measurements typically require sending spoofed packets from within the tested network, necessitating cooperation from network operators.

OSAVRoute is the first non-cooperative system capable of capturing the fine-grained characteristics of OSAV deployment. Unlike existing non-cooperative methods that can only identify the ** presence ** and **absence** of OSAV, OSAVRoute identifies both the **presence** and **absence** of OSAV and further measures its **blocking granularity** and **blocking depth**, achieving capabilities previously limited to cooperative methods. OSAVRoute accomplishes this by explicitly tracing the forwarding paths of spoofed packets, enabling identification of their generation and propagation behavior.

# Compilation
OSAVRoute with DNS can be compiled with
```bash
cd osavroute_dns && go build -o osavroute_dns
```
OSAVRoute with TCP can be compiled with
```bash
cd osavroute_tcp && go build -o osavroute_tcp
```
OSAVRoute requires `go1.22+`.

# Usage

## Stateless scanning
For stateless scanning, the common usage is
```bash
osavroute_dns -o <OUTPUT_DIR> -pps <PACKET_PER_SECOND> -nsend <N_SENDERS>
```
In this command, `OUTPUT_DIR` specifies the path to store output files. When scanning is finished, there will be three directors in `OUTPUT_DIR`:

- `OUTPUT_DIR/dns` stores response messages except ICMP Time-Exceeds messages received. Each line in each file is `<ORG_ADDR>,<RESP_ADDR>,<RESP_TYPE>`. `<ORG_ADDR>` is the destination address of the initial probing packet. `<RESP_ADDR>` is the responding address. `<RESP_TYPE>` is the protocol type of the response.

- `OUTPUT_DIR/icmp` stores intermediate files and is usually unimportant.

- `OUTPUT_DIR/icmp-re` stores ICMP Time-Exceeds messages received. Each line in each file is `<ORG_ADDR>,<FD_ADDR>,<RESP_ADDR>,<TTL>`. `<FD_ADDR>` is the destination address when the probing packet's TTL decreases to 0. `<TTL>` is the TTL of the initial probing packet.

`<PACKET_PER_SECOND>` is the sending rate you control. `<N_SENDERS>` is the number of goroutines used for sending packets. Larger `<PACKET_PER_SECOND>` requires larger `<N_SENDERS>`.

If you are using OSAVRoute with TCP, it is totally the same as DNS, except it stores response messages in `OUTPUT_DIR/tcp`.

## Early-filtering scanning
For early-filtering scanning, the common usage is

```bash
osavroute_dns -mode=early -i <INPUT_FILE> -d <DNS_OUT_FILE> -o <ICMP_OUT_FILE>
```

In this command, `<INPUT_FILE>` specifies the input file containing addresses you want to scan. This file is formatted by one address on each line. `<DNS_OUT_FILE>` specifies the path to store DNS responses and is formatted as `<ORG_ADDR>,<RESP_ADDR>,<TTL>` on each line. `<ICMP_OUT_FILE>` specifies the path to store ICMP Time-Exceeds messages and is formatted as `<ORG_ADDR>,<RESP_ADDR>,<TTL>`.

## Blocking granularity scanning
For blocking granularity scanning, the common usage is

```bash
osavroute_dns -mode=gran -i <INPUT_FILE>
```
In this command, `<INPUT_FILE>` specifies the input file containing addresses you want to scan. This file is formatted by one address on each line. 

# Note
1. OSAVRoute can automatically find your network interface and destination MAC address (MAC address of your gateway). However, you can always specify them by:
 ```bash
    osavroute_dns -o <OUTPUT_DIR> -pps <PACKET_PER_SECOND> -nsend <N_SENDERS> -iface <NETWORK_INTERFACE> -dmac <DEST_MAC>
 ```
2. The ADNS is also required when performing early-filtering scanning and blocking granularity scanning. The setup of the ADNS will not be specified here.
3. Early-filtering and blocking granularity scanning is based on DNS, and OSAVRoute with TCP cannot run them.
4. For more details, you can run
 ```bash
    osavroute_dns -h
 ```
 or
 ```bash
    osavroute_tcp -h
 ```
